# Note Taker

## Description

This repo contains the content for week 11

- I wanted to create a tool that would let users create notes to help remind themselves of daily tasks.
- The application can take a user's inputs and display them as a list on the page.
- I learned more about about express.js, and more about how to use require.

## Installation

- Link to deployed page: https://lwb-note-taker-f50f5a1d4a61.herokuapp.com/

- Get SSH key from https://github.com/Luwylbab/Note-Taker

- Clone the repository using [git@github.com:Luwylbab/Note-Taker.git]

## Usage

When a user sees the homepage, they can click "Get Started" to be taken to the main note page, where they can see all of the titles and descriptions of the notes saved within the database on the left side of the page. In the center of the page, there is a blank document with placeholder text, prompting a user to type a note title and description in the textboxes. Once the user is happy with their note, they can click "Save Note" on the right side of the page and it will be added to the database and display at the bottom of the list on the page. If the user wishes to delete a note from the  list, they simply need to click on the red trash can to the right of the designated note.
